# Backbone.Marionette and Browserify TodoMVC Example

This implementation of the TodoMVC application uses [Backbone.Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) --- an application library for Backbone.js --- and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) module bundling.

It is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as a build system and was created to assess how well these technologies work together (especially Browserify). Any improvement tips are welcomed.
